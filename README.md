# Emscripten WebAssembly SIMD "Hello World" Example

This is a basic example on how to get started with using the 
[x86 SSE instruction set](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/simd.html#compiling-simd-code-targeting-x86-sse-instruction-set) 
for targeting WebAssembly SIMD.

*Note:* WebAssembly SIMD is very experimental and is deactivated by default if supported at all. 
See [Implementation Status](https://github.com/WebAssembly/simd/blob/master/proposals/simd/ImplementationStatus.md) of the Browsers.
